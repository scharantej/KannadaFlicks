 **Feedback Analysis**

The feedback from the previous runs highlighted several areas for improvement:

1. **Lack of user authentication and authorization:** The application did not include any mechanisms for user authentication and authorization, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access and data manipulation.

2. **Insufficient error handling:** The application did not handle errors gracefully, resulting in cryptic error messages and a poor user experience.

3. **Limited scalability:** The application was not designed with scalability in mind, making it difficult to handle increased traffic or expand the application's functionality.

**Improvements for This Run**

Based on the feedback, I plan to make the following improvements in this run:

1. **Implement user authentication and authorization:** I will add user authentication and authorization mechanisms to the application to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify data.

2. **Improve error handling:** I will implement a comprehensive error handling mechanism that provides user-friendly error messages and logs errors for debugging purposes.

3. **Design for scalability:** I will redesign the application with scalability in mind, using appropriate architectural patterns and technologies to ensure that the application can handle increased traffic and future expansion.
