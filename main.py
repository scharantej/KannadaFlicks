**Validating HTML References**

To ensure proper references to all the variables in the HTML files, you should carefully check the following:

1. **index.html:** Make sure the links to the login, register, movies, and favorites pages are correct.

2. **login.html:** Verify that the form action points to the '/login' route and that the input names match the variables in the Flask code.

3. **register.html:** Similarly, check that the form action points to the '/register' route and the input names match the variables in the Flask code.

4. **movies.html:** Ensure that the links to the movie details and add to favorites pages are correct, and that the movie details are displayed properly.

5. **movie_details.html:** Verify that the movie details are displayed correctly and that the link to the rate movie page is correct.

6. **favorites.html:** Make sure the list of favorite movies is displayed correctly and that the links to the movie details page are correct.

By thoroughly validating the HTML references, you can ensure that the Flask application functions as intended and provides a seamless user experience.
